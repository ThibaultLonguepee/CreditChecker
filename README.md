## Downloading
You can download this repository as a `.zip` file.\

Or, you can also clone the repository using the following:
```
git clone git@github.com:ThibaultLonguepee/CreditChecker.git
```

## Building
The source files can be compilated using the provided Makefile.\
The available rules are:
- `make`: compiles into a file named `binary`
- `make run`: compiles and runs the binary
- `make re`: re-compiles all source files
- `make clean` / `make fclean`: clears all compilation outputs

## Running
Now that the project is built, you can run it.\
If you haven't used `make run` (or closed the application), you should be left with a binary file called `binary`.
You can execute it using
```
./binary
```
(flags will be supported later)
